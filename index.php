          The church has given me the space to express myslef and grow both spiritually and mentally. Through 
          the training and the school of ministry the church offers I have been able to understand the bible 
          and teach others about it.

          I would like to thank God for giving my mum a car that makes it easier for her to work and to get 
          around and gracing her with the strength to overcome anything. I also thank him for healing me

          "You can't have wisdom without having knowledge. You make judgement based on the knowledge
          you have received. Without knowledge there's no wisdom"

          The more you know what God doesn't want you to know, the more you'll deviate from His will. 
          Right knowledge shapes your path to a purposeful life

          The Old Covenant was between God who never changes and man(Israel) who changes.
           God was faithful to the terms of the Covenant, man was not. However, the New Covenant is between two parties who can't change; 
          God and His son therefore the Better Covenant.

          Foundation is good but if you only have a foundation then you'll never have a house.
